Xtra Mile
========

Xtra Mile is a marathon conducted by Parivartan, the social service wing of Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering, Kumaraswamy Layout. The previous editions of Xtra Mile have consistently attracted a large number of runners and some very significant celebrity and media attention. The proceeds from each of the previous marathons have been donated to various causes and have benefited many organisations in dire need of funds to support their functioning. This year's collections will also be donated to a cause, the fight against which is a battle of supreme importance to humanity - Cancer. Join us on the 1st of May and let yourself go on the track. When your legs get tired, run with your Heart!
